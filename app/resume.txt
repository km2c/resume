Resource
Senior Developer    June 2012 ~ October 2014

While working at Resource I had the privilege to work on some very exciting projects both internally and externally. My main focus has been leading front-end development using HTML, CSS, Javascript, PHP and Node.js for clients such as Victoria’s Secret, CVS, Huntington and Petsmart. One of the projects that I am most proud of is the World's Best Sport Bra page built for VS Sport. On this project I was the tech lead and was responsible for leading development and integration with the client platform. Another project I am proud of is a node.js based application for auditing client products on third party eCommerce sites. The application allowed clients to survey their resellers and monitor consistency between them. Recently I have been transitioning into a development manager position, which allowed me to drive technology discussions earlier in the creative process and manage resources to complete the project.
